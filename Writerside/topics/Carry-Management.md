# Carry Management ✏️

Carry Management covers logging carries, calculating prices, tracking score, and showing the related leaderboards.

## Logging carries

Use [](log.topic) inside a carry ticket. The bot validates the ticket context, collects the details, and posts a confirmation, after which it is further handled to give score.

## Prices

Calculate the price of carries using [](calc-price.topic) with carry type, carry tier, and amount.

## Score

- View your score with [](score.topic) or compare across members in [](leaderboard-score.topic).
- Staff may adjust scores using [](manage-score.topic).
