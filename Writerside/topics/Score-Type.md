# Score-Type

The score types are used to define the type of score that is being saved. \
These difference in how the score is gained after a service team member logs their services. \
Once score is gained by a service being logged, the service team member will get score for all score types (except for
the `Event` score type, which is only gained when the [](Carry-Type.md) has an event active). \
Additionally, the all-time score cannot be modified by bulk-changes (e.g. [](manage-score-reset.topic)).

## Possible values

- Current
