# Warning Type

The warning types are used to define the severity of the warning. \
The type of warning decides the [punishments](Warning-Action.md) that are given to a warned user, since they are
dependent on a single warning type. \
Additionally, warnings with the type strike will be automatically deactivated after 3 months.
