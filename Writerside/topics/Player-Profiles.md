# Player Profiles

The bot can display rich player profiles based on Hypixel data using the [dungeon-hub/hypixel-wrapper](https://github.com/dungeon-hub/hypixel-wrapper/) library.

## Showing a profile

- Use [](player.topic) with an IGN to fetch and display a player’s profile, including a SkyCrypt button.
- In carry tickets, the bot may automatically post a player profile for quick context.

## Safety checks

Use [](lookup.topic) to check whether a player (IGN) or Discord user is flagged across supported services. The profile and lookup complement each other: the profile shows in-game context, the lookup focuses on risk signals.
