# Warnings

Warnings are an easy way to log wrongful behavior of users, together with an automated way of punishing them based on the amount of warnings received.

## Displaying your warnings
To display the active warns you currently have, you can use the command [](warns.topic). \
> _Please note that you need to have the `Moderate Members` permission to be able to see warns of other users through this command._ 
{style="note"}

To display all warns, even if they [were deactivated](warn-deactivate.topic), you can use the command [](warn-list-all.topic).

## Managing warnings
It's possible to manage warns using the command [](warn.topic). All warnings that are created have a unique numerical id that is used across all commands \.
When a warning is [given to a server member](warn-add.topic), [punishments](Warning-Action.md) can be automatically applied to the user. \
> Currently, configuration of punishments is unavailable to server admins. If you wish to use them, please contact [the development team](mailto:admin@dungeon-hub.net)
{style="warning"}

[Punishments](Warning-Action.md) aren't updated/lifted when a warning is [deactivated](warn-deactivate.topic) or updated by an [evidence being added](warn-add-evidence.topic).
